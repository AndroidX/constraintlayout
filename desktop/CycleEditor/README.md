# Cycle Editor

This is an IntelliJ Gradle-based Java project. It is meant to aid previewing changes to parameters in KeyCycles for MotionLayout animations.

## 🔨 How to Run

Currently these tests require building and running two applications and enabling adb port forwarding.

You'll then want to run this Validation Tool by right clicking `android.motionlayout.cycleEditor.MainPanel.java` in IntelliJ and selecting `Run MainPanel.main()` - this should render a Java Swing application on your local machine.
