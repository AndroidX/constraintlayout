# ConstraintLayout 🗜️📏

![core](https://github.com/androidx/constraintlayout/workflows/core/badge.svg)

ConstraintLayout is an Android layout component which allows you to position and size widgets in a flexible way. This repository contains the core Java engine, Android library, validation tools, and experiments.

## ✨🤩 Key Features

* 📐 [Aspect Ratio](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout#ratio) defines one dimension of a widget as a ratio of the other one. If both `width` and `height` are set to `0dp` the system sets the largest dimensions that satisfy all constraints while maintaining the aspect ratio.
* ⛓️ [Chains](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout#Chains) provide group-like behavior in a single axis (horizontally or vertically). The other axis can be constrained independently.
* 🦮 [Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/Guideline) allow reactive layout behavior with fixed or percentage based positioning for multiple widgets.
* 🚧 [Barrier](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/Barrier) references multiple widgets to create a virtual guideline based on the most extreme widget on the specified side.
* ☂️ [Group](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/Group) constrols the visibility of a set of referenced widgets.
* 💫 [MotionLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/motion/widget/MotionLayout) a subclass of ConstraintLayout that supports transitions between constraint sets defined in MotionScenes.
* 🌊 [Flow](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/helper/widget/Flow) is a VirtualLayout that allows positioning of referenced widgets horizontally or vertically similar to a Chain. If the referenced elements do not fit within the given bounds it has the ability to wrap them and create multiple chains.
